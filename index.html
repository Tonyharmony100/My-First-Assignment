    <hr size="2" color="blue"><p>On this page I will give you Tips and Facts of music. <br>
        To start with let me enlighten you with these: <br>
        If you want to firm up your body head to the gym. <br>
        If you want to exercise your brain, listen to music. <br>
        There few things that stimulate the brain the way music does. <br> If you want to keep your brain engaged 
        throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a very great tool. It provides a total
        brain workout. <br> 
        Experts are trying to understand how our brains can hear and play music. A stereo system puts out 
        vibrations that travel through the air and somehow get into the ear canal. These vibrations tickle the
        ear drum and are transmitted into an electrical signal that travels through the auditory nerves to the 
        brain stem, where it is reassembled into something we perceive as music. <br>John Hopkins researchers have
        had dozens of jazz performers and rappers improvise music while lying down inside an FMRI (functional magnetic
         resonance imaging) machine to watch and see which areas of their brains light up. <br>Music is structural, mathematical and architectural. It's based on relationship between
         one note and the next. You may not be aware of it, but your brain has to do a lot of computing to make
         sense of it. <br>
